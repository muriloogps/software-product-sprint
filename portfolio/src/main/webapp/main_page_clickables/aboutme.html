    &emsp; Ever since I was a kid, what has always interested me the most is solving problems. 
    Coming up with a clever solution and/or understanding how something complex works is one of the most 
    satisfying activities, I realized. Computers always fascinated me due to the fact that such a small device 
    could perform insanely complicated tasks (such as displaying a colored browser or allowing me to talk to 
    someone thousands of kilometers away instantly). The more I searched and tried to learn about how all of 
    that was done, my enthusiasm with computer science would increase accordingly.

    &emsp; Around the 8th grade, I decided that I wanted to study Computer Science in the United States. Yes, I would 
    leave Brazil, and go to the US for college. Very little did I know of what was going to happen from there on. 
    It's crazy to think that I managed to do it, and also the next steps that I didn't even know about: getting 
    internships, making a lot of friends, and end up being accepted to a software development program at the 
    company I always admired the most: Google.</div>

    &emsp; This web portfolio is being done during Google's SPS 2020 program in week 1. I love the thrill of wanting 
    something (complete the program), but without knowing what's next (just like when I decided I wanted to come 
    to the US). So, let us all hang tight and see what happens next!</div>
